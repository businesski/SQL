/**In this project, I made my own table with a small set of “famous people”, more specifically famous actress from New Jersey. I then then added more tables
about them and joined them to create succint readable lists.

CREATE TABLE stars (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    nationality TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO stars (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Zoe Saldana", 44, "US");
INSERT INTO stars (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Diane Guerro", 36 , "US");
INSERT INTO stars(fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Lauren Cohan", 40, "US");
INSERT INTO stars(fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Meryl Strep" ,73, "United Kingdom ");

CREATE table wealth (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    stars_id INTEGER,
    net_worth TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO wealth (stars_id, net_worth) VALUES (1, "35 billion");
INSERT INTO wealth (stars_id, net_worth) VALUES (2, "2 million");
INSERT INTO wealth (stars_id, net_worth) VALUES (3, "4 million");
INSERT INTO wealth (stars_id, net_worth) VALUES (4, "71 million");

SELECT stars.fullname, wealth.net_worth
FROM stars
JOIN wealth
ON stars.id = wealth.stars_id;
SELECT * FROM wealth;
